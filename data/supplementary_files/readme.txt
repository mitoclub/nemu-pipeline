Supplementary Table 1. Additional species used in analysis of alignment sites variability.

Supplementary Table 2. Share of edges that have euclidean distances less than 5th percentile of reference distribution.

Supplementary Table 3. Share of edges that have euclidean distances greater than 95th percentile of reference distribution.

Supplementary Table 4. Number of successful runs of NeMu pipeline on mtDNA genes of 49461 Chordates species from MIDORI2 database. The values in the table indicate the number of species in a class for which the mutational spectrum of a given gene has been reconstructed. Last row shows the total presence of species for a given gene in MIDORI2. Last column shows the total number of mtDNA genes with reconstructed spectrum for a given class. Class names based on NCBI Taxonomy.
