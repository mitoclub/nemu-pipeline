# Notebooks

1. [Mammals spectra](./mammals_spectra_cats.ipynb) reconstructed by different approaches. Includes mutations probabilities analysis
2. [Expectated mutations analysis](./expectations_analysis.ipynb). Contains (1) estimation of synonymous mutations counts in invariable positions; (2) calculation of expected mutations counts (used in calculation of mutation spectra) taking into account invariable positions
3. [Distrubutions of mutations probabilities](./analyse_mutations.ipynb)
4. [Selection exploration](./position_analysis.ipynb) on Human and Mouse spectra (position-specific)
5. [Comparison of different approaches](./pastml_report_mammals_nd1.ipynb) to reconstruct spectra on Mammals TODO MERGE 2 GENES
6. [Sparse spectra exploration](./explore_sparse_spectra.ipynb) TODO Is it usefull to store here?
7. [Preparations to run NeMu on Mammals genes](./prepare_mammals_aln.ipynb) 
8. [Beast dataset preparation](./prepare_beasts_datasets.ipynb) for NeMu-pipeline execution. Extract mitochondrial genes from MIDORI for different taxa and select outgroup sequence for each species-gene
9. [Legacy report of *Nematoda* spectra](./_pastml_report_nematoda.ipynb)
