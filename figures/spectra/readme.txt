Mutation spectra of human and mouse: CYTB & ND1

Dir description:
- rec
    Reconstructed spectra using synonymous mutations from all tree edges

- rec_internal
    Reconstructed spectra using synonymous mutations only from internal tree edges
    
- rec_minus_sim
    Images present difference between reconstructed (observed) and simulated (expected) spectra using synonymous mutations from all tree edges
    Tables contain simulated (expected) spectra

- rec_internal_minus_sim
    Images present difference between reconstructed (observed) and simulated (expected) spectra using synonymous mutations only from internal tree edges
    Tables contain simulated (expected) spectra
